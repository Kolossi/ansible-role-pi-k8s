Ansible Role : Raspberry Pi4 Kubenetes install
=========

These roles will install a master and multiple workers joined in a cluster to Raspberry Pi4s newly initialised with raspbian buster from image and with ssh enabled by creation of the file /boot/ssh.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
